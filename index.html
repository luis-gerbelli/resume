                <p>My name is Luis Ricardo Gerbelli and I have lived in Sao Paulo – the most populous Brazilian city and the financial and economic center of the country – since I was born. I am married with two beautiful children.</p>
                <hr>
                <p>One of my passions is learning about new things. No matter the subject. I am curious, so new knowledge attracts me. As much as I can, I look for keeping studying and learning about multiple things.</p>
                <p>However, I have a special interesting for technologies. I love learning about avant-garde technologies, as artificial intelligence and machine learning. And that is why I work with it.</p>
                <p>Besides learning, I have other passions too. I like sports (soccer and football are my favorites), I like pets (we have two cats), and I like travelling. Traveling is something I really like to do. I am fascinated to know new places and new cultures.</p>
                <hr>
                <p>In the middle of 2021, my family and I are going to move to London, Ontario, Canada. My wife is going to study there, moving forward on her professional specialization, and the family will go along with, taking advantage of this enriched new experience.</p>
                <hr>
                <p>There is an important thing you have to know about me: I have hearing disability. When I was two years old, I lost entirely the listening ability on my right ear and had several loses on my left ear.</p>
                <p>Despite I am able to have an oral conversation, I have to make use of lipreading to compensate my hearing impairment.</p>
                <p>Thus, due to my disability, I really appreciate when, during a video call, it is possible for everyone to turn the camera on. This simple act always helps me a lot. &#128521;</p>
